Social Media Performance Tracker Dashboard:

This project was completed as part of my Data Analytics Internship at Future Interns. The goal was to analyze student behavior, social media usage patterns, and their impact on academics, sleep, and mental health using Power BI.

The dataset contains information about 705 students, including their academic level, gender, country, daily social media usage, addiction score, sleep hours, mental health score, and academic performance impact.

Key Insights:

Total Students Analyzed: 705

Average Addiction Score: 6.44

Average Daily Usage Hours: 4.92

Most Used Platform: Instagram (249 students), followed by Facebook (123)

India and USA had the highest average usage, while Canada, Mexico, and Turkey showed lower usage

A significant number of students reported that social media affects their academics

Students with fewer sleep hours showed lower mental health scores


Dashboard Features:

KPI cards showing total students, average addiction score, average usage hours, and academic level

Most used platform analysis

Gender distribution chart

Academic performance impact comparison (affected vs not affected)

Average usage by country

Mental health vs sleep analysis

Interactive filters for country, gender, and academic level


Skills Used:

Power Query for cleaning and transforming raw data

Data Modeling to build relationships between attributes

DAX for creating calculated metrics

Data Visualization and storytelling with Power BI


This project helped me understand how to turn raw behavioral data into actionable insights and how social media can influence academics, mental health, and lifestyle patterns.
